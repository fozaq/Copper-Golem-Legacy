# Changelog

All notable changes to the Copper Golem Legacy mod will be documented in this file.

## [1.21.1-0.0.5] - 2025-11-20

### Added
- **Mod Compatibility System**
  - Flexible tag-based system for chest interactions
  - New block tags: `golem_target_chests`
  - Target chests define where golems can **place items to** (all compatible chests)
  - Easy mod integration without code changes - just add block IDs to tags

- **Barrel Support**
  - Copper Golems can now place items into barrels
  - Correct barrel sounds (`BARREL_OPEN` / `BARREL_CLOSE`) when interacting
  - Added `minecraft:barrel` to `golem_target_chests` tag

- **IronChest Mod Integration**
  - Full support for all 14 IronChest variants (7 types + trapped variants)
  - Supported chests: iron, gold, diamond, copper, crystal, obsidian, dirt
  - Both regular and trapped versions work with golem item transport

- **Documentation**
  - `CHEST_COMPATIBILITY.md` - Complete guide for adding new mod support
  - `datapack_example/` - Example datapack for players to add custom chests
  - Instructions for three integration methods: direct block IDs, mod tags, datapacks
  - Examples for popular mods (Storage Drawers, Sophisticated Storage, AE2)

### Changed
- **AI Sound System**
  - Enhanced `playChestSound()` method with container-type detection
  - Automatic sound selection based on container type:
    - Copper Chests → Custom copper chest sounds
    - Barrels → Barrel-specific sounds
    - Regular Chests → Standard chest sounds
  - Improved blockState caching for better performance

- **Code Structure**
  - `ModTags.java` - Added `GOLEM_TARGET_CHESTS` constants
  - `CopperGolemAi.java` - Refactored to use tags instead of hardcoded block checks
  - More maintainable and extensible architecture

### Fixed
- **Container Detection Bug**
  - Fixed golem only detecting vanilla chests (`ChestBlockEntity`)
  - Now properly detects all container types including barrels and mod chests
  - Changed search from `ChestBlockEntity` to `BaseContainerBlockEntity`
  - Enables support for IronChest, barrels, and other mod containers

- **Container Animation Bug**
  - Fixed missing open/close animations for barrels and mod chests
  - Barrels now correctly animate using `OPEN` BlockState property
  - Chests use `blockEvent` for animation
  - All container types (vanilla, barrels, mod chests) now animate properly

### Technical
- Tag-based predicates in `TransportItemsBetweenContainers` behavior
- Container type detection with proper sound event mapping
- Support for datapack-based chest additions with `"replace": false` pattern
- Performance-optimized through Minecraft's tag caching system

## [1.21.1-0.0.4] - 2025-11-19

### Changed
- **Entity Size**: Reduced Copper Golem width from 0.7 to 0.6 blocks
  - Allows golem to fit through doors more easily

### Fixed
- **Chest Interaction Range**: Fixed vertical distance detection for chest interactions
  - Increased vertical reach from 0.5 to match horizontal distance (0.5-1.0 blocks)
  - Golems can now properly reach chests that are one block above or below them
  - Fixes issue where golem standing on a block couldn't interact with chest one block below
  
- **Spawn Behavior**
  - Copper Golems now perform idle walk animation after spawning before checking the chest they spawned on
  - Added initial 140-tick (7 second) transport cooldown when golem spawns
  - Prevents golem from immediately trying to interact with spawn chest
  - Allows idle walk/animation behavior to trigger naturally after spawn


## [1.21.1-0.0.3] - 2025-11-18

### Added
- **Copper Button System**
  - Four oxidation variants: copper_button, exposed_copper_button, weathered_copper_button, oxidized_copper_button
  - Four waxed variants: waxed_copper_button, waxed_exposed_copper_button, waxed_weathered_copper_button, waxed_oxidized_copper_button
  - 15 tick (1.5 seconds) activation time matching wooden buttons
  - Full oxidation progression over time
  - Oxidized buttons are non-functional and play copper hit sound when attempted to use
  - Waxed oxidized buttons remain functional

- **Copper Button Interactions**
  - Axe scraping removes oxidation levels (oxidized → weathered → exposed → copper)
  - Honeycomb application converts to waxed variant (stops oxidation)
  - Axe removes wax from waxed buttons
  - All interactions preserve button state (facing, powered, face position)
  - Proper sound effects (AXE_SCRAPE, HONEYCOMB_WAX_ON, AXE_WAX_OFF, COPPER_HIT)
  - Particle effects for scraping and waxing operations

- **Copper Golem AI: Button Pressing**
  - Copper Golems can now randomly search for and press nearby copper buttons
  - Golems walk at normal speed to buttons, stop completely when arriving, then play pressing animation
  - Custom button-pressing animation with arm and body movement (1 second duration)
  - Animation plays first, button is pressed at peak of animation (0.375s mark)
  - Must be within 0.8 blocks before stopping and starting animation (very close positioning)
  - **Improved Animation Behavior:**
    - Golem stops completely for 5 ticks before starting button press animation
    - Walk and run animations are completely disabled during button pressing
    - Idle animation no longer plays during button press state
    - Press animation plays exclusively without interference from movement animations
    - Animation timing: starts at tick 6, button pressed at tick 14, completes at tick 30
  - Proper stopping mechanism: halts navigation, clears all movement (including Zza), zeroes velocity, and stops walk animation
  - Configurable behavior via config file (enabled by default)
  - Golems search within 16 blocks horizontally and 4 blocks vertically
  - Global cooldown: 5-15 seconds (random) wait time after pressing any button before searching for next
  - Per-button cooldown: 20-40 seconds (random) before the same button can be pressed again
  - Prevents rapid consecutive button presses through timestamp-based tracking
  - Respects oxidized button state (won't press non-waxed oxidized buttons)

- **Configuration System**
  - New config file: `coppergolemlegacy-common.toml`
  - `golemPressesButtons` setting to enable/disable button-pressing AI (default: true)
  - Server/singleplayer controllable

- **Crafting Recipes**
  - Copper buttons craftable from corresponding cut copper blocks (1 cut copper → 1 button)
  - Waxed buttons craftable with button + honeycomb (shapeless)
  - Waxed buttons also craftable directly from waxed cut copper blocks
  - Copper chests craftable from 8 copper blocks in ring pattern
  - All recipes for all oxidation variants

- **Assets & Data**
  - Complete blockstate files for all button variants with all orientations (ceiling, floor, wall)
  - Block and item models using vanilla copper block textures
  - Loot tables for all button and chest variants
  - English translations for all new blocks

- **Creative Tab Integration**
  - All copper buttons added to Redstone Blocks creative tab
  - Both normal and waxed variants included

### Technical
- `CopperButtonBlock` class implementing WeatheringCopper interface
- `WaxedCopperButtonBlock` class for non-oxidizing variants
- `PressRandomCopperButton` AI behavior for button-pressing logic with enhanced stopping mechanism
- `CopperGolemModel` with state-based animation control to prevent walk/run animations during button pressing
- `CopperGolemLegacyConfig` class for mod configuration
- Button reference system linking waxed/unwaxed variants
- FMLCommonSetupEvent listener for button reference initialization
- Enhanced animation state management for cleaner, more realistic button pressing behavior

## [1.21.1-0.0.2] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Item Sorting Bug**: Fixed Copper Golems skipping slots when placing items in chests
  - Removed duplicate slot increment causing grid pattern (slot filled, slot skipped, slot filled, etc.)
  - Fixed incorrect stack size calculation when stacking items (`spaceLeft` vs `toAdd`)
  - Items now fill chest slots consecutively without gaps
