A Minecraft mod that brings back the Copper Golem from the Minecraft Live 2021 mob vote. This lovable copper companion oxidizes over time, can hold items, press copper buttons, and eventually becomes a statue.

## Features

### Copper Golem Entity
- **Natural spawning**: Place a carved pumpkin on a copper block to summon your golem
- **Oxidation system**: Copper golems age through four stages (normal, exposed, weathered, oxidized)
- **Item interactions**: Give items to your golem - they'll store them in their chest and show them off
- **Button pressing**: Golems randomly press copper buttons, acting as natural randomizers
- **Player-oriented spawning**: Golems and their chests face toward you when spawned

### Copper Chest
- **Four oxidation levels**: Copper chests age naturally alongside your golem
- **Double chest support**: Combine two copper chests for double storage
- **Copper-specific sounds**: Each oxidation level has unique opening and closing sounds
- **Waxing support**: Preserve your chest's oxidation level with honeycomb

### Copper Statue
- **Four poses**: Standing, running, sitting, and star pose
- **Interactive**: Right-click with an empty hand to cycle through poses
- **Restoration**: Use an axe to bring oxidized statues back to life as golems
- **Custom sounds**: Unique audio for placing, breaking, and interacting

### Audio Design
- **50+ custom sounds**: Complete sound system for entities, blocks, and interactions
- **Oxidation-specific audio**: Different sounds for each weathering stage
- **Item interaction feedback**: Audio cues when golems pick up, drop, or interact with items
